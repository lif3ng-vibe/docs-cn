This is a selectable build and review model from `sdlc-conventions.md`'s component
menu. The mission owner decides whether it fits the work. Lock stamps in this model
are ADDITIVE: approval appends metadata and never rewrites authored bytes, so a
candidate's identity survives its own approval.

## The model in one paragraph

Slices build IN PARALLEL across every build-class seat, each in a DISJOINT FILE
TERRITORY, each merged serially by one integrator the moment its candidate freezes
with builder-proven receipts. Independent review happens ONCE PER WAVE over the wave's
whole accumulated range — two reviewers with different vantages (ideally different
runtimes), never the writers — and their findings drive fix rounds that re-earn both
verdicts at the round's final revision. Checks stay per-slice (failing-test-first
proof, verify-by-effect, honest receipts); rounds happen per-wave.

## The mechanics

1. **PLAN:** wave entries in the plan of record; the planner shapes specs; the plan
   authority locks them. Every slice gets a real workspace or proof has no home.
2. **DISPATCH:** batons fan out with EXCLUSIVE file territories. THE BRIEF IS THE
   UNIT: every assignment carries the goal, the acceptance criteria, the complete
   context routes (exact paths), the territory — and this standing grant: "Navigate
   the implementation yourself: derive what you need, research, spawn readers,
   decide your own build order. Ask when stuck; the orchestrator is here to help."
   DEFAULT SCOPE IS THE WHOLE SPEC, built in one sustained run to ONE frozen
   candidate. Handing out anything smaller requires naming the reason on the brief
   itself (an unresolved decision, a live territory conflict, a genuine
   fork-in-the-road risk) — an unexplained small chunk is a dispatch defect.
   Territory overlap = serialize. Conflict discovered mid-build = STOP AND RULE.
   Why: the builder holds the spec and the code; decisions about how to build
   belong where the building context lives. Detailed sequencing instructions were
   scaffolding when models were weak; today they are a cage, and per-command
   routing is the failure mode, not diligence.
   THE BRIEF IS A MAP, NOT THE TERRITORY. Distillation is welcome — for a minimal
   slice the brief may honestly be richer than the spec — but it is never the
   receiver's ONLY context: the builder's first act is self-onboarding from the
   routed reading list (the mission-install pattern at slice scale), then checking
   the map against the ground it actually stands on. Nobody knows the ground floor
   better than the builder; the wide angle lives a layer up. When the ground
   disagrees with the map, that is a finding to raise — not a reason to follow
   the map off a cliff.
3. **BUILD:** failing-test-first against a pristine base with committed final test
   bytes; freeze a single candidate revision; receipts cite the FINAL revision
   (re-earned after any rebase).
4. **MERGE:** integrator-only, serially, verified at source each time (candidate
   parent equals pre-merge tip; changed files equal declared territory). Merge
   announcements are REBASE TRIGGERS for every open candidate.
5. **WAVE REVIEW:** fires when the wave's build completes. Two independent reviewers,
   base-scoped at the tip, writers excluded from reviewing their own work. The two
   gates ask DIFFERENT questions — does the structure hold, versus does each claim
   survive contact with source. That is the design, not redundancy.
   Reviewers also review for DRIFT, not only defects: does the built thing still
   match the acceptance criteria the brief stated — is this still the doghouse the
   owner asked for, or did locally-defensible steps accrete toward a moon base?
   Plot-loss is a first-class finding with the same standing as a logic defect.
   Reviews also DISPOSE each miss by cause: CONTEXT-GAP — the spec or its routes
   lacked what the moment needed (a planning finding; the fix lands in the spec) —
   versus JUDGMENT-GAP — the context was there and the call was wrong (a builder
   finding; the fix is a check). One word in the verdict artifact. The rate this
   produces is the calibration the dispatch shape tunes on.
6. **FIX ROUNDS:** findings become forward-fix candidates (merges stand; merged is
   not running). One re-review pass per round re-earns both legs at the final
   revision. Narrow rechecks for narrow corrections.
7. **SEAL:** both legs clear at one revision = wave sealed; the next slot opens.

## THE WAVE IS THE CARE DIAL

Wave COMPOSITION is the control surface for how carefully a piece is handled: a
large, complicated, or load-bearing slice gets a wave OF ITS OWN (its review ceremony
fires for it alone); a big piece can even split across waves. This decouples what an
older model conflated: mission and slice workspaces stay flexible organizational
containers; waves are the separate layer that sequences work, assigns it, and prices
its handling care. Care is a per-piece property, never a per-mission one.

## When to use it

Many small-to-medium, root-caused, evidence-backed slices; enough seats to
parallelize; territories that partition cleanly; an integrator who can merge serially
and verify fast.

## When NOT to use it

Design-uncertain or shared-region work (one slice, classic two-leg review, or a
design session first). Anything irreversible within the hour (publish, cutover,
destructive operations) — that is the heavy path. And when no independent non-writing
reviewers exist: nothing ever self-reviews; without them the wave gate is theater.

## Failure modes and mitigations

- **Freeze-merge races:** a candidate freezes seconds before a merge moves the tip.
  Mitigation: zero-overlap restack with content-identity proof (stable patch-id) in
  an isolated worktree; builder-side self-catch on merge announcements.
- **Evidence theater:** a failing test that fails for the wrong reason reads
  identical to a real one. Mitigation: reviewers re-derive the failures
  independently; false characterizations retire to a correction history, never a
  silent rewrite.
- **Presence-not-absence tests:** asserting the true line exists while the false
  line still prints. Rule: pin the ABSENCE of the false claim in every encoding.
- **Phantom checkout status:** merge-by-reference leaves a shared checkout's index
  stale. Never build or commit from a shared checkout; sync its index at fences.
