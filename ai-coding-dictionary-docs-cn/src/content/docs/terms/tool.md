A function the [harness](/terms/harness) exposes for the [agent](/terms/agent) to call — Read, Write, Bash, Search. Tools are how an agent perceives and acts on the [environment](/terms/environment): it can't see the environment except through [tool results](/terms/tool-result), and can't change it except through [tool calls](/terms/tool-call). Each tool call costs an extra [model provider request](/terms/model-provider-request), since the result has to go back to the model before it can decide what to do next.

Tools most coding agents ship with:

| Tool   | What it does                                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Read   | Returns a file's contents as a tool result                   |
| Write  | Creates or edits a file in the [filesystem](/terms/filesystem) |
| Bash   | Runs a shell command and returns its output                  |
| Search | Finds files or text matching a pattern across the codebase   |

A tool is defined by three things: a name, a description of what it does, and a schema for its parameters. The harness sends these definitions to the [model](/terms/model) with every request, and the model chooses a tool the same way it produces everything else — by writing [tokens](/terms/token), in this case a structured call with arguments. The model never executes anything itself; the harness reads the call, runs the function, and sends back the result.

The tool list sets what the agent can do. A capable model with a narrow tool set is a narrow agent: it will route everything through whatever it has, which is why agents lean so heavily on Bash — a shell is one tool that reaches most of the system. To give an agent a capability cleanly, add a tool for it; [MCP](/terms/mcp) is the standard for plugging in tools from outside the harness.

Tool definitions occupy [context](/terms/context) on every request, so a large tool set has a standing cost before any tool is called — and many similarly-described tools make the model worse at picking the right one.

_Usage:_

"Can the agent query staging directly?"

"Add a `psql` tool to the harness, scoped read-only on staging. Without a tool for it, the agent's blind to anything outside the filesystem."
