The relevant information the [agent](/terms/agent) has access to right now. The abstract noun — not the raw input the model sees (that's the [context window](/terms/context-window)), not the running history (that's the [session](/terms/session)), but _what the agent knows that's pertinent to the task_. "Loading something into context" means making it part of this set; "context engineering" is the discipline of curating it.

The three terms separate cleanly:

| Term           | What it names                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Context        | The task-relevant information the agent currently has               |
| Context window | The literal [token](/terms/token) sequence the model sees per request |
| Session        | The running conversation the [harness](/terms/harness) stores         |

The separation matters because context is a measure of quality, not quantity. A context window can be nearly full and the context still poor — thousands of tokens of stale tool output, none of it about the task at hand. It can also be nearly empty and the context excellent: the one type definition the task turns on.

Most day-to-day failures trace back to context. When the agent invents an API, contradicts a decision, or guesses at a schema, the first question is what was in context when it did — usually the relevant fact was never loaded, or was buried under [attention degradation](/terms/attention-degradation). The fix is curation: load what the task needs, keep out what it doesn't.

_Usage:_

"It keeps inventing fields that aren't in the type."

"The type file isn't in context — it's reading the call sites and guessing. Read the definition in first."
