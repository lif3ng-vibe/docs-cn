# Contributing to Nimbus

AI coding agents have changed how software gets made. The teams that do well
adapt their workflows to that change rather than bolting agents onto the old one.

This repo explores what building software with agentic workflows looks like. Treat it as a long-running experiment.

Writing code is no longer the bottleneck — agents handle most of the research,
implementation, and first-pass review. Deciding _what_ to build and _how_ is
where the leverage is, so that is where we plan to spend human attention and what we ask
contributors to help with.

## How to contribute

Two paths:

| You want to… | File it as… | Humans | Agents |
|---|---|---|---|
| Report a bug or propose a fix | an **Issue** | [New issue](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/issues/new/choose) | [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) |
| Request a feature or enhancement | a **Discussion** | [New discussion](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/discussions) | [`.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/feature-request.yml`](.github/DISCUSSION_TEMPLATE/feature-request.yml) |

A well-framed problem is worth more to us than a finished PR. Send the
clearest account of the bug, or the strongest case for the feature — the full
context that lets us guide an agent through the work. If we take it on, we
implement it and try our best to attribute it to you.

## Pull requests

Start with an issue or a discussion, not a PR. If we decide to take your bug or
feature forward, a maintainer approves you right there in the thread — from then
on your pull requests stay open and go through normal review. Until then, PRs
from outside the team are closed automatically and pointed back here.

A drive-by AI-generated PR is cheap to write and expensive to review. Deciding
what to build, and how, is the part we'd rather do with you up front.

## For maintainers

Before you open a PR:

- Put the change in the right place: framework bugs and plumbing in `nimbus-docs`, styling and layout in the starter, optional extras in the registry.
- Edit `packages/nimbus-starter-source/`, never the `templates` branch — that's generated, and direct edits get clobbered on the next release.
- Add a changeset for anything user-facing. Starter edits need a `create-nimbus-docs` changeset, or the freshness guard fails the PR.
- For every intentional public API break, apply the `breaking-change` PR label and add a linked entry to the comprehensive upgrade manifest. Use `optional` only when every existing site keeps building with the same output without acting; conditional entries stay `review-required`. Every entry carries manual guidance; add a migration ID, detector, transform, bounded task, and focused fixtures only when maintainers deliberately classify the change as common, mechanical, and canonically detectable. Run `pnpm upgrades:check`. CI verifies the declaration, pending changeset, and manifest continuity.
- Check that `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm -r test`, and `pnpm templates:check` pass.

For Markdown pipeline changes, extend the small mixed-format fixture in
`scripts/fixtures/content-integrity/`. The template check installs the packed
framework into a starter and verifies rendered content across clean and warm
builds. Use bounded combinations in unit tests to check preservation of unrelated
source across formats, nesting, Unicode, and line endings. A parser-only pass or
one production corpus is not sufficient evidence of consumer compatibility.

### Local development

Requires **Node ≥ 22.12.0** and **pnpm 9** (pinned via `packageManager`, so Corepack fetches it for you).

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev                 # kitchen-sink dev server at http://localhost:4321 — every component on one page
```

`pnpm dev` runs the server in the background and prints its own `astro dev stop` / `astro dev status` commands (Ctrl-C won't stop it). Edit files under `packages/nimbus-starter-source/src/` and the page hot-reloads.

Working on the CLI, templates, or a real scaffold:

```sh
pnpm build:templates     # regenerate the shipped template variants
pnpm templates:check     # generate + scaffold + build one variant end to end
pnpm local               # scaffold a throwaway site against your local packages
pnpm typecheck           # typecheck the whole workspace
pnpm -r test             # every package's tests, incl. the registry tier-invariant guard
```

`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENT.md` carry the deeper architecture notes — you don't need them to run the repo.

### Preview releases

To let someone install and test a PR before it merges, add the `pr preview`
label to it. That triggers the [Preview release](.github/workflows/preview-release.yml)
workflow, which builds `@cloudflare/nimbus-docs` and `@cloudflare/create-nimbus-docs`
and publishes them to [pkg.pr.new](https://pkg.pr.new) — nothing hits the npm
registry. A bot then comments on the PR with install commands like:

```sh
pnpm add https://pkg.pr.new/@cloudflare/nimbus-docs@<PR#>
```

The label is removed automatically; re-add it to publish a fresh preview.

Note that `create-nimbus-docs` previews are limited: the scaffolder fetches
templates pinned to `#templates-v<version>`, so a preview still pulls the last
*released* templates, not the PR's starter edits. To test starter changes end to
end, scaffold with `--template-dir` against a local checkout (see `pnpm local`).
