/**
 * Glob matching for the `ignore: string[]` option (`internal-link`,
 * `image-ref`). Backed by `picomatch` — full glob syntax (`**`, `*`,
 * `{a,b}`, `?`, extglobs, …), not just exact match or `prefix/**`.
 *
 * Why picomatch, not hand-rolled:
 * - Previous matcher covered `/api/**`, `/changelog/**` fine.
 * - Couldn't express a leading any-depth wildcard (e.g. match `llms.txt`
 *   at any depth).
 * - Real gap: parity with common picomatch-backed links validators,
 *   whose exclude lists use exactly that leading-wildcard pattern.
 * - Taking the dependency restores parity instead of flattening every
 *   migrating project's exclude list to fit the minimal matcher.
 *
 * Caching contract:
 * - Compiled matchers cached per *raw* `ctx.options.ignore` array identity
 *   (`WeakMap`).
 * - That array is the same reference for the life of a lint run (from
 *   resolved rule config, not per-file).
 * - So: one compile per run, not one per file.
 * - Callers must pass the array through **unfiltered** — filtering happens
 *   in here. A caller-side `.filter()` allocates a new array per call,
 *   which breaks the cache key and silently turns this into a no-op cache.

 * - Each pattern gets its trailing slash stripped before compiling, so a
 *   bare `"/api/"` (no `/**`) still matches `/api` exactly — same as the
 *   previous matcher.
 * - Non-string and empty-string entries are dropped — `picomatch("")`
 *   throws, which would silently disable the whole rule (the engine skips a
