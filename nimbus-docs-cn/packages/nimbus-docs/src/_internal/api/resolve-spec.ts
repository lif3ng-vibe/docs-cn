/**
 * Resolve a Nimbus config `api[]` entry into a `SpecSource` the engine
 * can parse. A string `spec` is a **local file path** (relative to the project
 * root) and is read to its text contents here; an object `spec` is used inline.
 *
 * Resolving to *contents* (not a path) is what makes `buildApiModel`'s memo
 * content-addressed: an edited spec produces different bytes → a different key
 * → a fresh parse, with no path-string staleness. The loader (build graph) and
 * the render helper (SSR graph) both call this against the same file, so they
 * derive an identical `SpecSource` and each parses at most once per graph.
