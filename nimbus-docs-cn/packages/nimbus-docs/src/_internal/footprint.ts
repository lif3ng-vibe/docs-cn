// (which emits the `.nimbus/features.json` cache) and `check` (build-free) agree
// without either trusting a stale artifact.
//
// A feature RECIPE declares its render mode + env keys; PRESENCE comes from the
// footprint. First-party loaders/features are npm packages, so presence is keyed
// off the dependency. Community loaders installed directly aren't declared here,
// so `check` can't see their env — a documented limitation, not a false pass.
