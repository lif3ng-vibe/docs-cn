## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- [#162](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/162) [`982a47d`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/982a47ddbc23d899e71770804c3facf757ae15a4) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Register API collections from the Nimbus config. `apiCollection()` now takes no arguments and reads the `api` entry whose `collection` matches its key in `src/content.config.ts`, so each spec is declared once, in the inline Nimbus config in `astro.config.ts`:

  ```ts
  // astro.config.ts
  const nimbusConfig = defineNimbusConfig({
    site: "https://example.com",
    title: "Example",
    api: [{ collection: "api", spec: "./src/api/openapi.yaml" }],
  });

  // src/content.config.ts
  export const collections = {
    docs: defineCollection(docsCollection()),
    api: defineCollection(apiCollection()),
  };
  ```

  The `api-reference` recipe now uses this shape and no longer creates `nimbus.config.ts`, so `nimbus-docs check` validates the whole config statically and `add adapter-cloudflare` edits `rendering` in place.

  A collection key with no `api` entry fails content sync, and an `api` entry without an `apiCollection()` under its key fails the build, including a key registered with another loader. Both messages name the Nimbus config and `src/content.config.ts`, and `nimbus-docs check` reports the same mismatches without building.

  `apiCollection(options)` and `@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/config` are unchanged, and sites built by earlier versions of the recipe keep building with no changes. **Upgrade note:** in `astro dev`, that shape silently ignores edits to the `api` entry in `nimbus.config.ts` until a manual restart. To pick up edits automatically, move the Nimbus config back into `astro.config.ts`, delete the lookup in `src/content.config.ts`, and register the collection with `apiCollection()`. `nimbus-docs upgrade` lists these steps.

  Also fixes `astro dev` after an `astro.config.*` edit, for every site: collections are re-synced when Astro restarts the dev server, so docs pages keep their partial headings and Markdown routes and `llms.txt` keep working, instead of losing prepared data until a manual restart. Spec edits keep re-indexing API pages after that restart.

- [#165](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/165) [`05efc7a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/05efc7ab365d2c3bec3f5fb457110e64a739e093) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Keep more of the OpenAPI document in API reference pages and their Markdown versions:

  - **Request body `required` and `description`.** `ApiOperationPage` gains `bodyRequired`, `bodyDescription`, and `bodyDescriptionHtml`, read from the operation's Request Body Object. Each is present only when the spec states it.
  - **Every response media type.** The primary media type is chosen exactly as before and is now exposed as `ApiResponseView.mediaType`. Each other media type is listed in `ApiResponseView.additionalMedia` (`ApiResponseMediaView`: `mediaType`, `anchor`, `fields`, and optional `truncated`, `union`, and `example`), with fields citable at `<operation>.response.<status>.<media-token>.<field>`. The build no longer warns that it renders only the first media type. A media type whose coordinate token would clash, with a sibling media type (such as `application/vnd.a+json` beside `application/vnd.a-json`) or with a field of the primary body (a property named `text-csv` beside `text/csv`), no longer fails the build, for responses or request bodies: it gets a short hash suffix instead. Media types that don't clash keep their existing coordinates.
  - **Readable union branch labels.** A `oneOf`/`anyOf` branch without a `$ref` is labeled by its `title`, then by the type of its folded `allOf`, then by the type of its `enum`/`const` values, then `object` when it has properties, and otherwise `Option N`. Branches are never labeled `unknown`. Field types are unchanged.

  The generated Markdown shows the body's required flag and description, one labeled body per response media type, and the new branch labels. All changes are additive, and `apiSchemaVersion` stays `1`. Pages whose spec uses none of these constructs render the same HTML and Markdown as before.

- [#164](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/164) [`b8f4d05`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/b8f4d05b90e208c841d8cbd62d927985695e301b) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Return each page's URLs from the page helpers, build OG cards from one path function, and reduce the `llms.txt` routes to one factory call each.

  - `getDocsPage`, `getCollectionPage`, `getDocsPageProps`, and `getCollectionPageProps` now return `markdownUrl`, `sourceUrl`, and `ogImageUrl` alongside `entry`, `Content`, and `headings`. `IndexedEntry` gains `ogImageUrl`. All three are site-relative with no base path and come from the same function, so a page route no longer builds them by hand:

    ```astro
    const { entry, Content, headings, markdownUrl, ogImageUrl } = page;
    const socialImage = entry.data.socialImage ?? ogImageUrl;
    ```

  - `getOgImagePages()` from `@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/runtime` returns the `pages` map for astro-og-canvas's `OGImageRoute`, one entry per indexed page, keyed so each card is written at the page's `ogImageUrl`. `ogImageUrl` is `/og/<page>.png`, derived from the page's route, the same rule the `api-reference` recipe uses. This fixes broken OG cards: collection and version root pages, such as `/blog/`, linked to `/og/blog/index.png` while the card was written at `/og/blog.png`, and IDs containing a dot, such as `v1.2/guide` or the webhook `payment.succeeded`, had their card name cut at the last dot, so several pages shared one card. noindex pages linked to `/og/<id>.png`, but the old OG route skipped them and never wrote that card. Root pages, dotted IDs, and noindex pages now link to cards that exist.
  - `llmsRoute()`, `llmsFullRoute()`, and `llmsSectionRoute()` from `@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/agent-endpoints` return the `{ GET }` behind `src/pages/llms.txt.ts` and `llms-full.txt.ts`, and the `{ GET, getStaticPaths }` behind `src/pages/[section]/llms.txt.ts`. Each `GET` returns 404 for a missing or unknown index and, on request, a 500 without details when the index can't be read, as the starter's routes did:

    ```ts
    // src/pages/[section]/llms.txt.ts
    import { llmsSectionRoute } from "@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/agent-endpoints";

    export const prerender = true;
    export const { GET, getStaticPaths } = llmsSectionRoute();
    ```

  - The build now warns about every baked Markdown page and every `llms.txt` index that no prerendered route generated, and names the route that serves it. This catches a shared Markdown route that re-exports `markdownRoute()` from another module and is rendered on request. Sites that serve these pages on request on purpose can ignore the warning.

  Hand-built URLs, existing OG routes, and existing `llms.txt` routes keep building with unchanged output. The `page-urls-and-llms-routes` upgrade entry lists the lines each route can drop.

- [#161](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/161) [`b45ca22`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/b45ca22fc603b96beddc7ff9114d0cfba1f7d84f) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Serve the Markdown and source versions of every collection from two route files. `markdownRoute()` and `markdownSourceRoute()` from `@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/agent-endpoints` return `{ GET, getStaticPaths }`:

  ```ts
  // src/pages/[...slug]/index.md.ts
  import { markdownRoute } from "@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/agent-endpoints";

  export const prerender = true;
  export const { GET, getStaticPaths } = markdownRoute();
  ```

  - One shared route serves every collection's `/<page>/index.md`, including docs versions and API reference pages. `markdownSourceRoute()` serves `/<page>/index.mdx` for every authored page. Collections added later need no new route files.
  - A more specific route file, such as `src/pages/changelog/[...slug]/index.md.ts`, takes over its collection. The shared route skips every URL that route matches, so Astro reports no route conflicts. If the more specific route doesn't generate every page it matches, the build warns and names the missing paths, or fails when `prerenderConflictBehavior` is `"error"`.
  - The shared routes must be prerendered. The build fails if a route using `markdownRoute()` or `markdownSourceRoute()` is rendered on request.
  - API pages now have baked Markdown assets, so `getMarkdownStaticPaths({ collection: "<api>" })` returns their entries. Hidden API versions are excluded, like hidden docs versions.

  Existing per-collection routes keep working and need no change. Sites that delete the `api-reference` recipe's `src/pages/<api>/[...slug]/index.md.ts` no longer publish Markdown for hidden API versions. The `shared-markdown-routes` upgrade entry explains how to remove unmodified per-collection routes.

### Patch Changes

- [#164](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/164) [`c26b52b`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/c26b52bb47ebf6590bbecb810354c702b6deb8f5) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Support dotted version slugs such as `v1.2`. Links to a dotted version root now keep their trailing slash (`/v1.2/`, not `/v1.2`) in the sidebar, breadcrumbs, version picker, alternate links, and `IndexedEntry.url`; before, the last segment was read as a file extension. `src/content.config.ts` keys such as `"docs-v1.2"` are now recognized, so Nimbus no longer warns that collections can't be identified statically and keeps its collection checks on.

- [#167](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/167) [`2223c45`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/2223c458917e5fcbdd3f4b8e2382d1ff22e1df36) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Keep builds running when an upgrade range contains only optional guidance, while surfacing those entries in the build log and upgrade commands.

- [#166](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/166) [`9eef696`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/9eef696ec6c4b0d4afcda983eb2e9080bfd90019) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - When GitHub refuses the template lookup (or rejects the token) in `nimbus-docs outdated` or `diff`, the error now explains how to fix it: set `GIGET_AUTH` to a GitHub token, or skip the lookup with `--to` or `--template-dir`. It also says when GitHub's rate limit resets, or quotes GitHub's reason. The CLI help now mentions `GIGET_AUTH`.

### Patch Changes

- [#160](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/160) [`08b963b`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/08b963b1f0ce9e0243713a35d37df5f08b0c918f) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Prose `api.ref:` citations now resolve correctly in HTML output:

  - They include the site's base path. On a site with `base: "/docs"`, `[change status](api.ref:api:changeWidgetStatus)` now links to `/docs/api/...` instead of `/api/...`, matching the Markdown alternate and `llms-full.txt`.
  - Citations in `.md` pages now resolve. Previously they rendered as raw `api.ref:` links; only `.mdx` pages were resolved.
  - Citations resolve when the project directory is reached through a symlink.

- [#157](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/157) [`cde0751`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/cde0751aae4002677c995d137c4f74d20e1e8595) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Render authored OpenAPI request examples as selectable examples in API reference pages and generated Markdown.

- [#158](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/158) [`9f024b0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/9f024b00bd26bdc412557284d31cfb3260d19718) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Reduce static API reference build memory by storing lightweight collection entries and projecting complete pages during prerendering. Server output continues to use prepared entries so requests do not parse OpenAPI specifications. Keep build-only Markdown parsing out of generated server bundles.

  project command shim.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- [#129](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/129) [`3fd7d15`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/3fd7d15581feedf1799735b3c71d54ee394b88d1) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Add a versioned breaking-change manifest, explicit reviewed upgrade baselines, agent-readable migration plans, shared `check` and `outdated` diagnostics, safe starter drift updates, starter agent upgrade guidance, and automatic migration guidance during Astro configuration.

- [#142](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/142) [`5343933`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/53439333949669b03cf9d66df0ee2bb0a2b0e636) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - **Breaking:** API coordinate manifests now use the compact v2 format exclusively.
  The existing `getCoordinatesManifest()` helper emits it by default; the endpoint,
  citation syntax, page URLs and anchors are unchanged. Repeated page URLs are stored
  once per namespace in a single JSON file. There is no additional helper or setting.

  Upgrade publishers and consuming sites together, rebuild publishers, and refresh
  checked-in manifests before rebuilding consumers. Old readers cannot consume v2,
  and new readers no longer consume v1. Stage both sides before switching live sites
  if uninterrupted citations are required. Local v1 references fail with rebuild
  guidance; remote v1 references warn and are skipped.

  Custom `CoordinatesManifest` readers must use collection `pages` and `versions`
  page groups instead of the old flat `entries`. Each group has a literal `url` and
  coordinate-keyed fragments: `null` means no fragment, `0` means the coordinate
  itself, and a string is the exact fragment. Do not relabel old JSON as v2.

  The linked upgrade-manifest entry includes rollout, verification and rollback
  guidance. This changes citation transport, not Astro's content store or SSR behavior.

- [#139](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/139) [`ea8cd46`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/ea8cd46ae8f3a607881f7b744f1a604305e59980) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Render MDX admonitions with Sätteri's native directive parser, preserving nested
  content, code examples, plain titles, aliases, and scoped opt-outs. Use
  `markdown.mdastPlugins` and `markdown.hastPlugins` for native extensions.
  Explicit incompatible processors must disable Nimbus admonitions, while Astro
  MDX options continue to pass through unchanged. Native admonitions now apply to
  `.mdx` only; review existing admonition directives in `.md` files. Astro 7.2.6
  or newer is required.

### Patch Changes

- [#122](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/122) [`4b51ebb`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/4b51ebbab227449e271bbe5a627ecd796c1c9e02) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Allow user-owned Astro pages and scaffolded Markdown and `llms.txt` endpoints to use native rendering semantics while retaining entrypoint-aware checks for active Nimbus contracts and composing with unrelated integration routes. These dynamic endpoints now resolve their payloads when rendered on request. Endpoint helpers now live at `@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/agent-endpoints`; the existing `@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/publication` entrypoint remains supported. Sub-path sitemaps now list the deployment root once.

- [#138](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/138) [`3f7c16a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/3f7c16a45b3178c1fbd66e09a0c4375e690feec9) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Preserve authored root-relative links and unrelated source across Markdown and
  MDX, including HTML containers, fenced examples, Unicode, and CRLF. Keep plain
  Markdown unchanged when generating Markdown and agent endpoint output.

- [#137](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/137) [`728e753`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/728e7536600e3e46f5ac9541291c70204f6d2d84) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Update generated projects to Astro 7.2.8 and align the Node adapter with Astro's updated runtime API.

## 0.13.1

### Patch Changes

- [#110](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/110) [`e6fb2b1`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/e6fb2b15c2f2a2227276fcc61baa71d21cc5d3fb) Thanks [@sansynx](https://github.com/sansynx)! - Reject registry install paths that resolve outside src through symbolic links.

- [#109](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/109) [`f4d0d78`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/f4d0d7879a6b3564147efbed810ea56dce0c7ec9) Thanks [@sansynx](https://github.com/sansynx)! - Preserve casing in static page routes during duplicate-route checks.

- [#119](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/119) [`bd179bb`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/bd179bbe65f1c09d4375ce189865fdee90d543d7) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Index API response coordinates for direct citations, and keep scaffold progress readable in non-interactive terminals. Emit canonical trailing slashes for API navigation links.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- [#114](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/114) [`3c0d794`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/3c0d7940e50792acc6b1781e0c099026d60dbf1d) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Generate deterministic Markdown versions for every public page, prepared MDX source versions for authored pages, `llms.txt` indexes, `llms-full.txt`, and merged partial headings at build time. Request-rendered pages now consume compact prepared heading data, and custom component transforms and partial resolvers are configured through `markdown.componentMap` and `markdown.partialResolver`. Worker bundles no longer include partial-expansion parsers. Calls to `renderEntryAsMarkdown` or `getEntryMarkdown` that still pass `<Render>` partials now fail instead of attempting runtime expansion; migrate custom Markdown routes to the prepared helpers exported by `@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/build`.

  Rename prepared publication APIs without compatibility aliases: `TwinSurface` becomes `PreparedMarkdownSurface`, `PreparedTwin*` becomes `PreparedMarkdown*`, `PreparedCorpus*` becomes `PreparedLlms*`, `getPreparedTwin*` becomes `getPreparedMarkdown*`, `getPreparedCorpus*` becomes `getPreparedLlms*`, and `renderCorpusMarkdown` becomes `renderLlmsFullMarkdown`. Move integration customization from `twins.componentMap` and `twins.partialResolver` to `markdown.componentMap` and `markdown.partialResolver`.

  Keep framework assets, metadata, starter navigation, and generated API links inside Astro's configured deployment base path. Replace the removed `withBaseRoute` runtime export with `withBase`; site-relative inputs to `withBase` must be logical, unbased paths.

  Keep generated `.nimbus` build data out of source control, deduplicate sitemap roots on subpath deployments, and advertise prepared MDX source responses as `text/mdx` consistently across static and request rendering.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- [#93](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/93) [`43c161a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/43c161a993385c9fd121c2732b0fa37a6d74175d) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Add first-party OpenAPI reference support to Nimbus.

  - Configure local or inline OpenAPI specs as routed, version-aware collections with operations, schemas, tags, webhooks, generated samples, and every declared request-body media type.
  - Install an editable `api-layout` UI that shares Nimbus's docs shell, navigation, breadcrumbs, banners, mobile behavior, and deep-linkable field and code-sample controls. The copied `ApiFieldList` field iterator is explicitly typed so the scaffolded UI type-checks cleanly under a consumer's strict TypeScript.
  - Publish per-page Markdown, agent indexes, corpus entries, coordinate manifests, and `api.ref:` citations across local and cross-site documentation.
  - Harden generated-consumer delivery with exact registry dependencies, working pnpm installs from scaffold roots, and base-aware canonical, Markdown, sitemap, and agent URLs through the new public `withBase` helper.
  - Control how operation pages are addressed, and stay resilient to messy specs. By default, operations that lack a usable `operationId` no longer abort the build — they warn and fall back to a path-derived coordinate, so real-world specs (e.g. Cloudflare's `brand-protection` operations) build; set `api[].requireOperationId: true` on specs you own to keep that fatal, while route-hostile paths and coordinate collisions stay fatal regardless. For readable, path-derived URLs, opt into the `resource-action-v1` route convention: set `api[].routes: { convention: "resource-action-v1" }` (per version in a family) to derive slugs like `charges/list` from an operation's method and path, decoupled from `operationId` so route-hostile identifiers no longer poison URLs. Trim shared bases with `stripPathPrefixes` (e.g. `["/v1"]`), pin individual pages with an `operations` (`operationId` → slug) map, and inspect how each slug resolved (`override` / `derived` / `fallback`) via the new `getApiRouteProvenance` export. Derivation collisions, reserved-route segments, unused overrides, cross-version slug drift, and unknown config keys (e.g. a `stripPrefixes` typo for `stripPathPrefixes`) are reported with pointed messages; the default (no `routes`) keeps the legacy `operationId` slugs unchanged.

- [#104](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/104) [`79d6430`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/79d6430fd96d0446a27f3c32375fe3f8ddce7c1a) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Add server-output support and the `@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/adapters` export.

  Nimbus can now target on-request (server) output in addition to static. A new `@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/adapters` public export ships the adapter recipes plus the shared `astro.config` and `wrangler.jsonc` emitters, and two new CLI verbs opt an existing site in: `nimbus-docs add server-output --adapter <vercel|node|netlify|cloudflare>` (alias `nimbus-docs add adapter-<id>`). The installer rewrites `astro.config` at the `// nimbus:adapter` marker and, for Cloudflare, creates a server `wrangler.jsonc` or replaces an exact Nimbus static config. Cloudflare installs add request rendering when the active Nimbus config has no explicit rendering policy; explicit or ambiguous policies are preserved and receive an agent-ready handoff. Adapter dependencies are saved at their exact resolved versions so subsequent runs accept the installed declaration. Custom and alternate Wrangler configs are preserved with manual adaptation instructions.

  Withdraw the `gated` config option because it did not hold as a confidentiality boundary. Existing `gated` config now fails with a migration error; to keep a page out of the build, move the page out of a routed content collection.

  Fix env preflight precedence and parsing to match Vite, including empty shell overrides, last-wins `.env*` files, and inline dotenv comments. Adapter dependency validation now resolves pnpm catalog declarations, and compatibility warnings reflect the versions installed by the command.

  Fix `NimbusHead` URLs for sub-path deployments by applying Astro's configured base to sitemap, LLM index, social image, JSON-LD, canonical, and version-alternate URLs. Root deployments and already-based paths are unchanged.

  Keep registry component render counters compatible with adapter-defined `Astro.locals` types, including Cloudflare server output.

- [#104](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/104) [`862df4a`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/862df4ac2786fbc46e0e40a5517c27f4dc39e8da) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Add Cloudflare request rendering for canonical content collections.

  Nimbus now supports collection-level build and request rendering policies with validated defaults and per-collection overrides. Request-rendered prose and API routes use response-aware page helpers, prepared API models, request-safe partial headings, 404 responses, and build-derived syntax-highlighting assets without shipping source OpenAPI specs to Workers. Cloudflare server scaffolds enable request rendering by default, and generated pnpm configuration installs Satteri's WASI fallback alongside the current architecture.

  Preserve sitemap, Pagefind, Markdown, and agent-index discovery for request-rendered routes. Pin the tested sitemap integration, clean up synthetic Pagefind staging files transactionally, and generate cross-collection Open Graph images in new starters.

### Patch Changes

- [#99](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/99) [`2965d9f`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/2965d9ff95bc06a90dee6eaf1e7cc7383fee36e1) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - - Honor `noindex: true` on machine discovery surfaces. `noindex` pages now drop out of `/llms.txt`, per-section `llms.txt`, and the `/llms-full.txt` corpus (matching on-site search, which already excluded them) while staying directly addressable and navigable. A single exported `isDiscoverable` predicate defines the contract for custom index/corpus routes.
  - Pin `@vercel/detect-agent` to `1.2.3`, the last release published with npm provenance. Versions `1.2.4`/`1.2.5` dropped provenance, tripping pnpm's `ERR_PNPM_TRUST_DOWNGRADE` and blocking lockfile updates. Pinning holds at the attested artifact until upstream restores provenance.
  - Fix navigation for pages under CJK (percent-encoded) paths. Route matching now decodes percent-encoded request paths (`toRouteKey`), so active sidebar state, breadcrumbs, and prev/next resolve correctly instead of falling back to a URL-encoded trail; the breadcrumb URL fallback also decodes segment labels.

### Minor Changes

- [#86](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/86) [`b4b0dc3`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/b4b0dc3b8746bd148b82eca458fbc5a1f500acd7) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - `makeDisclosure` now marks closed content `inert` so collapsed regions leave the tab order, keeping keyboard focus out of hidden disclosure panels.

Sites can opt out with `mdx: { optimize: false }`.

  Verified the generated starter with optimization on and with `mdx: { optimize: false }` forced; the rendered HTML is structurally equivalent for element names, attributes, and non-whitespace text. Render parity is semantic and structural rather than byte-identical: raw bytes differ due to serializer escaping and inter-block whitespace, but the rendered document is lossless.

  Spot-checked the starter `components` page, which includes JSX tags in prose, inline code with `<...>`, quoted code, and package names. The optimized and opt-out renders preserve those special-character text probes and match structurally.

  Constrain the supported Astro peer range to `>=7.0.0 <7.1.0 || >=7.2.0 <8.0.0`: the 7.1.x line is excluded while its static-build regression is open upstream, but 7.2.x is admitted (verified against a sub-path build). Generated templates and the dev pin stay on the verified 7.0.x line.

This is a breaking change for any project using `astro-icon` directly.

  **Why:** `astro-icon` stamped a generated `lastModified` timestamp into its virtual module on every build, invalidating thousands of cached pages in Astro's incremental build cache. The package is unmaintained so an upstream fix isn't coming.

  **What's new:** Nimbus now provides `virtual:nimbus/icons` (a Vite plugin) and `@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/components/Icon.astro`. The plugin auto-detects installed `@iconify-json/*` packages and loads local SVGs from `src/icons/`. The component API is compatible with `astro-icon` (`name`, `size`, `width`, `height`, `is:inline`, `title`, `desc`, and all `<svg>` attributes). SVG bodies are passed through `replaceIDs` so internal IDs (clipPath, mask, gradient defs) are unique per render — preventing collisions when the same icon appears more than once on a page.

  **Breaking changes:**

  - Remove `astro-icon` from your `package.json` and `astro.config.ts`
  - Replace `import { Icon } from "astro-icon/components"` with `import Icon from "@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/components/Icon.astro"`
  - SVG output structure changed: SVGs are always inlined; the previous `<symbol>`/`<use>` pattern produced duplicate DOM IDs when the same icon was used more than once on a page, so it has been removed. Any CSS or JS targeting `symbol` or `use` elements will need updating.

  **Migration:**

  ```diff
  - import { Icon } from "astro-icon/components";
  + import Icon from "@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/components/Icon.astro";
  ```

  Starter templates updated: removed `astro-icon` dependency and `icon()` integration from `astro.config.ts`; all component imports updated to the new path.

  `new URL(path, Astro.site)` resolves against the origin only and drops the configured `base`, so the `rel=sitemap` link, the LLM-index `rel=alternate`, `og:image`/`twitter:image`, the JSON-LD `isPartOf.url`, the versioned `canonical`, and the cross-version `rel=alternate` all pointed at the origin root and 404'd under a sub-path. Every internal path handed to `new URL(..., Astro.site)` is now `base`-prefixed via a `withBase` helper, matching the existing `BASE_URL` handling for the favicon and Shiki stylesheet.

  Root deployments (`base: '/'`) are unaffected: the helper is a no-op when no base is configured, and already-based paths pass through unchanged (idempotent).

The dev middleware that serves `_nimbus/shiki.css` compared the request path exactly against the based asset path, but Vite strips `base` from `req.url` at a non-root base, so the request 404'd and tokens fell back to their inherited colour. It now matches by suffix, serving the stylesheet regardless of how Vite presents `base`. Production was unaffected — the stylesheet is written statically at build time.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#64](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/pull/64) [`e1e4e8d`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/e1e4e8d313952ffb197eb31f0a63983e93d20adc) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Add `nimbus-docs check` — a build-free preflight that reports readiness honestly

  One command a human, CI, or agent runs to catch setup, structural, authoring, and type problems before a build. It runs four categories — environment (Node floor, config locatable, `site` not a placeholder, pagefind, wrangler), structure (config Zod, duplicate routes, MDX component resolution — the same validators the build gates on), authoring (the shipped lint rules), and types (a build-free type-check) — and normalizes every result into one envelope.

  The types category type-checks your TypeScript with your project's own `tsc`, build-free — no `astro build`, no `astro sync`, nothing spawned (your TypeScript is resolved from your project, never bundled into the CLI). Astro transpiles rather than type-checks, so a type error never fails the build on its own; catching it in the preflight is the point. Because `tsc` can't parse `.astro` SFCs, their internals and prop types are out of scope (that needs `astro check`); an injected ambient `declare module "*.astro"` keeps `.ts` files that import `.astro` components from being false-flagged.

  **The report separates two axes that a naive error count fuses: buildability vs. correctness, and evaluated vs. not-evaluated.** `--json` carries three top-level signals:

  - **`status`** (`passed` | `failed` | `partial`) — the whole-run verdict across every scope that ran.
  - **`readiness`** (`buildable` | `blocked` | `unknown`) — derived from env + structure only: does the project clear Nimbus' buildability checks? A type error is `status: failed` but `readiness: buildable` (the site still builds — Astro strips types); a placeholder `site` is `blocked`.
  - **`ok`** — kept for back-compat, still exactly `errors === 0`.

  Exit is `1` only when `status === "failed"` (`ok === false`); `partial` and `readiness` never move it. Usage errors are `2`.

  Coverage is a first-class channel, not a fake warning. A sub-check that can't run yet — opt-in authoring rules or link-checking before `astro build` materializes `.nimbus/lint.json` / `.nimbus/routes.json`, or the type-check before `.astro/types.d.ts` exists — is reported as a **note** under `scopes[].notes[{ code, reason, requiresBuild?, requiresInput? }]`, counted in `summary.notes`. A note is never a `finding`, never carries a `fix`, and never affects the exit code; it resolves by making the missing thing exist (a build), not by `--fix`. A run that skipped types or authoring rules therefore never declares itself build-ready on an unverified scope. The headline is earned: _"Buildable"_ on a scaffold whose correctness scopes are still notes, _"Ready"_ only when every scope that ran evaluated clean with zero notes.

  - `--json` emits `{ ok, status, readiness, summary{errors,warnings,notes,fixable,durationMs}, scopes[{scope,status,reason?,notes[]}], findings[{scope,code,severity,file,line,message,fixable,fix}] }`. An agent's fix loop terminates on `status !== "failed" && summary.fixable === 0` — a `partial` run with nothing left to fix is a stop (optionally build, then re-check), not a `--fix` retry.
  - `--fix` applies safe fixes (installs, config rewrites via a static parse of `astro.config.ts`), prompting on a TTY for values it can't invent (e.g. the production `site` URL) and skipping them headless.
  - `--env` / `--structure` / `--lint` / `--types` run a single category.
  - `init` now ends with the env readiness pass — using the same scope-status vocabulary — so a fresh scaffold hears about a placeholder `site` at setup time.

  `lint` is preserved as a first-class command with its own "zero `.mdx` → exit 1" guard; `check --lint` runs the same rules inside the preflight envelope. (Unlike `lint`, a config-only project with no `.mdx` is not an error for `check`.)

  Config validation for `site` is now stricter: it must be an absolute `http(s)://` URL with a host. Previously a value missing the `//` (e.g. `https:example.com`) slipped through `new URL()` and shipped a broken canonical origin; it is now rejected both build-free by `check` and at build time by the config gate.

  In `indexDisplay: "overview-leaf"` mode, the section-root pin relabelled and moved any top-level link whose slug matched the current section — including standalone top-level pages with no content beneath them. On a flat top-level of single pages, that pulled the current page to the front and renamed it "Overview" on every page. Pinning now requires the section to actually have content under it, so standalone pages stay put and keep their label.

Error messages, install hints, and `--help` reference `pnpm dlx @cloudflare/nimbus-docs …` (matched to your package manager — `npx` / `yarn dlx` / `bunx`), so a first-run `dlx`/`npx` user can copy-paste them, and they never resolve the unrelated legacy _unscoped_ `nimbus-docs` package on npm. For example, an unknown slug now suggests `pnpm dlx @cloudflare/nimbus-docs list` rather than `nimbus-docs list`. Once `@cloudflare/nimbus-docs` is a project dependency you can still call the `nimbus-docs` bin directly (via `pnpm exec` or an npm script) — `--help` documents both. The "framework is behind" nudge from `outdated` now suggests your package manager's update command instead of a hardcoded `npm update`.

  - **`nimbus-docs init`** — reconstruct a `nimbus.json` for a project that lacks one (scaffolded before this record existed, an existing Astro site adopting Nimbus, or a deleted record), matching installed components against the registry and marking what it can't recover.
  - **`nimbus-docs outdated`** — a read-only check across both tiers: starter files behind their `templates-v*` tag (which `git diff` can't show) and registry components whose recorded bytes differ from the registry.
  - **`nimbus-docs diff [file]`** / **`diff --apply <file>`** — review upstream/your changes to starter files, and pull a clean upstream change per file (never a merge).
  - **`nimbus-docs add <slug> --overwrite`** — re-install a component over your copy (review with `git diff`). `add` also records each install in `nimbus.json`.

  Also adds a `getRouteFlags` layout-flag helper and a CI guard for the registry tier invariants.

  **Migration — `add --yes` no longer overwrites files you own.** It now assents to prompts (dependency installs, etc.) but keeps existing files on conflict, so a bare `-y` in CI never clobbers your code. Use `--overwrite` to replace files.

  ```bash
  # before — --yes overwrote conflicting files
  nimbus-docs add card --yes

  # after — replace files explicitly
  nimbus-docs add card --overwrite

In particular, a leading any-depth wildcard like `**/llms.txt` is now supported — the previous hand-rolled matcher had no way to express that.

  The published `dist` inlined a local copy of `@shikijs/types`'s
  `ShikiTransformer` surface instead of importing it, so `defaultCodeTransformers`
  never deduped against the `@shikijs/types` that Astro's `<Code>` uses — breaking
  `astro check` in scaffolded sites. The build now keeps `@shikijs/types` and
  `@shikijs/transformers` as external type imports in the emitted `.d.ts`, and
  `@shikijs/types` is a runtime dependency (`^4.2.0`) so the import resolves for
  consumers. No API or runtime behavior change.

  The `incrementalBuilds` option, the `partialResolver` hook, and the
  `nimbus-docs clean` command are gone, along with the internal cache module
  that backed them. Astro 7 owns incremental building now, and running a second
  cache on top of it under `node_modules/.astro` was redundant and a
  stale-serve risk.

  **Breaking:** if you passed `incrementalBuilds` or `partialResolver` to
  `nimbus()`, remove them — they no longer exist on `NimbusIntegrationOptions`.
  No replacement is needed; a plain `astro build` is the supported path, and
  Astro 7's native incremental building applies without any Nimbus opt-in.

  `nimbus-docs` now peers on `astro ^7.0.0` (was `>=6.4.0 <7.0.0`) and builds
  against the Astro 7 ecosystem: `@astrojs/mdx ^7`, `@astrojs/markdown-satteri
^0.3.4` (Sätteri `^0.9`), Vite 8. The markdown pipeline — Sätteri plus the
  `hastPlugins`/`mdastPlugins` seam and Shiki dual-theme output — is unchanged;
  the Sätteri `0.6→0.9` jump left the plugin-definition types intact, so no
  seam code moved.

  Astro 7 makes Sätteri the default processor, which unblocks opt-in server
  output alongside it (the gate for hosted MCP, Ask AI, and content
  negotiation).

  **Starter templates**: Tailwind v4 now wires through `@tailwindcss/vite`
  instead of the PostCSS plugin, which does not build under Astro 7's Vite 8
  bundler. Scaffolded projects gain `@tailwindcss/vite` and drop
  `@tailwindcss/postcss` + `postcss.config.mjs`.

  **Breaking (peer)**: sites must be on Astro 7. The `unified()` escape hatch
  for remark/rehype plugins still works, but `@astrojs/markdown-remark` must
  now be installed explicitly (`pnpm add @astrojs/markdown-remark`) — pnpm does
  not expose it for import even though `@astrojs/mdx` pulls it transitively.

  - **`/llms-full.txt`** — the whole published site as one deterministic
    markdown document, via the new `renderCorpusMarkdown()` helper behind a
    ten-line starter route. Scope matches the root `llms.txt` (primary +
    secondary collections, non-current doc versions excluded); collation is
    sorted and timestamp-free, so output is byte-identical across rebuilds.
    `/llms.txt` links to it.
  - **Raw-source twin at `<page>/index.mdx`** — the authored MDX body served
    verbatim with the same canonical frontmatter block as the `.md` twin.
    Twin grammar: `index.md` is the downleveled render for reading,
    `index.mdx` is the source. The `.md` twin's `Source:` line now points at
    the `.mdx` twin instead of itself.
  - **`IndexedEntry` gains `sourceUrl`** (site-relative URL of the raw-source
    twin; `undefined` for entries without a string body) **and `version`**
    (the entry's version label resolved from the `versions` manifest;
    `undefined` on unversioned sites and non-docs collections). On versioned
    sites every twin's frontmatter carries a `version:` label so agents can
    pin a version; unversioned sites are byte-for-byte unchanged.
  - **`astro` peer range is now `>=6.4.0 <7.0.0`**, declaring the Astro 6
    requirement that `@astrojs/mdx@6` always implied. Astro 7 support lands
    as its own release.

  When `sidebar.isolate.boundaries` was configured (e.g. `["learning-paths/*"]`),
  a single page inside the boundary group that linked **out** of the boundary's
  URL subtree — a relative cross-section `external_link` — made `isolateToBoundary`
  discard the module containing it (and its parent boundary group) and fall through
  to the first fully-in-prefix group in DFS order. Every page under that learning
  path then rendered the wrong rail: a sibling module (or a clean nested subfolder)
  flattened, or — under a multi-segment glob — the rail silently left unisolated.

  The boundary group is now identified positively instead of by "all descendants
  under the prefix." Groups are stamped at build time with the URL subtree they
  own (`_routeKey`): an autogenerate group's directory path, a non-primary
  collection mount, or a manual group's `segment`. `isolateToBoundary` selects
  the stamped group whose key equals the glob-implied prefix **and** which
  contains the current page (via the existing `containsRouteKey`, already robust
  to `_neverActive` links and `_indexNeverActive`/external landings).
  `flattenSidebar` is unchanged, so `getPrevNext` pagination is unaffected.

  Behavior notes:

  - Selection now pins to the glob-implied depth. On the rare nested-wrapper
    single-path tree — where the previous code isolated at whatever wrapper
    happened to be fully in-prefix — the isolated rail now sits at the glob depth
    instead. This aligns single- and multi-path trees, which previously diverged.
  - A group must declare the URL subtree it owns to be an isolate boundary
    (autogenerate `directory`, collection mount, or manual `segment`). A plain
    manual `{ items }` group with no `segment` is treated as a visual grouping
    rather than a URL boundary; if such a group previously isolated via the old
    descendant scan, add a `segment` to keep it selectable.

  - **Wide tables no longer overflow the page.** A table with more columns than
    the content column could fit slid under the TOC rail and forced page-level
    horizontal scroll on desktop (the old scroll fallback only applied under
    640px). A `<table>` can't both fill its column and scroll — `overflow` is
    ignored on `display: table` — so scroll now lives on a wrapper:
    `nimbus-docs/markdown` exports a `tableScroll()` hast plugin that wraps
    class-less tables in a `.nb-table-scroll` container, and the starter wires it
    up with matching styles. Short tables still fill the column with no dead
    space.
  - **`<Badge>label</Badge>` renders its children.** The `text` prop is now
    optional and falls back to `<slot />`; previously a slotted label was
    silently dropped and the badge rendered empty.
  - **`nimbus-docs add` no longer crashes in non-TTY environments.** A file
    conflict without `--yes` in CI, a pipe, or an agent crashed with a raw
    `uv_tty_init returned EINVAL` trace when the overwrite prompt tried to open a
    TTY that wasn't there. It now detects non-interactive stdin and exits with an
    actionable message pointing at `--yes`.

- [`24113e0`](https://github.com/cloudflare/nimbus/commit/24113e0aa7b999618fb7d1503ca17ba3e0cdc86b) Thanks [@MohamedH1998](https://github.com/MohamedH1998)! - Clear the Node and pnpm version gates that broke a fresh scaffold

  - **Node floor raised to `>=22.12.0`.** Astro requires Node ≥ 22.12; the old
    `>=20.0.0` promise was a floor a scaffolded site could not actually build on
    (Node 20 is EOL and fails `astro build` with `Node.js v20.x is not supported
by Astro!`). CI now runs Node 24 everywhere.
  - **`pnpm install` no longer hard-fails under modern pnpm.** pnpm ≥ 10 gates
    dependency install scripts and pnpm ≥ 11 turns an ignored build into a hard
    error (`ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`, exit 1). Scaffolded projects now ship a
    `pnpm-workspace.yaml` that declines exactly the packages with install scripts
    — `esbuild` and `sharp` (plus `workerd` on the Cloudflare target, which pulls
    `wrangler`) — never a blanket approval. All three ship working prebuilds, so
    the site still builds while the supply-chain surface stays minimal. Verified
    green on pnpm 9, 10, 11, and npm.
