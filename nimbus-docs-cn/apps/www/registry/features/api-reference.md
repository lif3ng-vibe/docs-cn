# OpenAPI reference

You are helping the user mount an **OpenAPI (Swagger) spec** as a first-class
reference collection on a Nimbus docs site. One spec file in, and the user
gets: a routed page per operation/schema/tag under `/api`, an alternate Markdown
version of every page, and automatic `llms.txt` indexes and `llms-full.txt`.

The render is Nimbus's own — the spec is parsed once per build and projected
into a stable view-model. There is no third-party reference renderer.

**For hand-authored API docs, this is the wrong recipe.** If the user wants to
write their API docs by hand as MDX pages (prose, curated examples, no spec),
that's a plain content tree — use `nimbus-docs add new-collection` and pick
`api` as the collection name. This recipe is specifically for generating the
reference **from an OpenAPI document**.

Read this entire file before making any changes.

## 1. Discovery (read-only)

Before prompting the user or writing anything, inspect the project:

- `package.json` — confirm `@cloudflare/nimbus-docs` is a dependency. If not,
  stop and tell the user this isn't a Nimbus project. Note the package manager
  (`pnpm`/`npm`/`yarn`) from the lockfile so later commands match.
- `src/content.config.ts` — read it in full. Note the `defineCollection`
  import and the existing `collections` object shape so your edit matches.
- The Nimbus config — the object passed to `nimbus(...)` in `astro.config.ts`
  (the starter declares it as `const nimbusConfig = defineNimbusConfig({ … })`).
  Read it; you'll add an `api` entry there. Leave it where it is: don't move it
  into another file.
- `src/pages/[...slug].astro`, `src/pages/[...slug]/index.md.ts`,
  `src/pages/llms.txt.ts`, `src/pages/llms-full.txt.ts`, and
  `src/pages/[section]/llms.txt.ts` — the primary docs page, Markdown version,
  and index routes. The API page route is a sibling of the primary docs page,
  so match its style.
  If any are missing, stop and install `nimbus-docs add ai-native` first.
- Confirm `src/pages/[...slug]/index.md.ts` calls `markdownRoute()` from
  `@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/agent-endpoints`. This shared route serves every
  API page's `.md` version, so the reference needs no Markdown route.
  If it instead passes `collection: "docs"` (an older starter), stop: the
  new pages would get no `.md` files. Ask the user to update it first
  with `nimbus-docs diff <file> --apply` if it is unmodified, or to
  replace it with the three-line version from the `ai-native` recipe,
  wrapping it to keep any customizations.
- Locate the OpenAPI spec. Ask the user for its path if it isn't obvious
  (common: `src/api/openapi.yaml`, `openapi.json`, `api/spec.yaml`).

## 2. Prompt the user

### Q1. Where is the OpenAPI spec?

A local file path relative to the project root (e.g. `./src/api/openapi.yaml`).
YAML or JSON in OpenAPI 3.x format. Convert Swagger 2.0 documents to OpenAPI
3.x first. Remote URLs are not supported in v1 —
if the user only has a URL, have them save it into the repo first.

### Q2. Confirm the collection name + URL prefix (default: `api`).

The collection name doubles as the URL prefix, so `api` mounts the reference at
`/api`. It **must** be lowercase letters, digits, and dashes (`a-z0-9-`), must
not collide with an existing collection, and must not be `docs` or `partials`
(reserved). This recipe writes
its routes under `src/pages/<collection>/` — substitute your chosen name for
`api` everywhere below if it differs.

## 3. Plan

Print a short, exact plan to the user **before** writing anything:

- Install the reference layer — `nimbus-docs add api-layout` — which copies four
  owned, editable components into `src/components/ui/` (ApiLayout, ApiSidebar,
  ApiFieldRow, ApiCodeRail) with their registry deps (Badge, cn, …), and installs
  the API engine's peer packages: `@scalar/openapi-parser` (the spec parser) plus
  `openapi-sampler` and `@readme/httpsnippet` (the code-sample generators). These
  stay out of the framework bundle, so they only land when you mount a spec.
- Declare the spec **once**, as an `api` entry in the Nimbus config in
  `astro.config.ts`.
- Register the collection with one line in `src/content.config.ts`:
  `api: defineCollection(apiCollection())`. It reads its entry from the config,
  so the spec is never declared twice.
- Create `src/pages/api/[...slug].astro`. The shared
  `src/pages/[...slug]/index.md.ts` route serves the Markdown versions.
- Resulting URLs: `/api` (overview), `/api/<slug>` (each page), the matching
  `/api/<slug>/index.md` versions, and `/api/llms.txt`.

Wait for confirmation before executing.

## 4. Execute

### 4a. Install the reference layer

Run the registry recipe — it copies four owned, editable components that render
the view-model, and installs the API engine's peer packages:

```sh
pnpm exec nimbus-docs add api-layout   # or: npm / yarn
```

This lands `ApiLayout`, `ApiSidebar`, `ApiFieldRow`, and `ApiCodeRail` under
`src/components/ui/` (with their Badge/cn registry deps), and installs three
optional peer packages of `@cloudflare/nimbus-docs`: `@scalar/openapi-parser`
(required to parse the spec — the build fails without it), plus `openapi-sampler`
and `@readme/httpsnippet` (the curl/TypeScript/Python sample generators). Nimbus
keeps these out of its bundle and lazy-loads them, so docs-only sites never
install them.

The components read the frozen view-model only (hrefs, anchors, flags, grouping
are all pre-resolved) and own nothing but their look — restyle them freely,
they're yours now. The route in 4d composes them.

Confirm your `src/styles/globals.css` carries the method-colour tokens
`--nb-m-get`, `--nb-m-post`, `--nb-m-put`, `--nb-m-delete`, and `--nb-m-other`
(with the four `[data-mode="dark"]` overrides). Sites scaffolded by
`create-nimbus-docs` already ship them; the sidebar method chip and the page
route pill share these tokens, so without them the method glyph/pill fall back to
`currentColor` (uncoloured) rather than the get→green / post→blue / put→orange /
delete→red palette.

If you're wiring the engine by hand instead of via this recipe, install those
peers yourself: `@scalar/openapi-parser` is required; the other two are optional
(their absence just omits code samples).

### 4b. Declare the spec in the Nimbus config

Add an `api` entry to the Nimbus config in `astro.config.ts`, next to the
existing fields. Edit the config where it already is:

```ts
const nimbusConfig = defineNimbusConfig({
  // …your existing site / title / etc…
  api: [{ collection: "api", spec: "./src/api/openapi.yaml" }],
});
```

`collection` is the name from Q2. `spec` is the path from Q1, resolved from the
project root (not the current working directory — builds from a monorepo root or
`--root` resolve correctly). `spec` may also be an inline OpenAPI object. Add a
`label` for a friendlier name in build diagnostics; it defaults to the
collection name. To mount more than one spec, add one entry per spec.

### 4c. Register the collection

In `src/content.config.ts`, add one line to the `collections` object. Use the
collection name from 4b as the key:

```ts
import { apiCollection } from "@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/content";

export const collections = {
  // …docs, partials…
  api: defineCollection(apiCollection()),
};
```

`apiCollection()` takes no arguments: it indexes the `api` entry whose
`collection` matches its key. If Q2 chose another name, use it as the key
(quote the key if it contains a dash). For multiple specs, add one line per
`api` entry, each under its own literal key; Nimbus doesn't find collection
names behind a spread. A key with no `api` entry, or an entry with no key,
fails the build with a message that names both files, and
`nimbus-docs check` reports the same mismatch without building.

### 4d. Scaffold the HTML route

The route is thin: `getApiStaticPaths` enumerates one path per page, and
`getApiRoute(Astro)` reads the page props and shared navigation prepared by the
content loader, then marks the current navigation path active. It never reads
or parses the OpenAPI source at request time. Hand both results to `ApiLayout`
(installed in 4a). `ApiLayout` composes `ApiSidebar` (verb chips +
active-section pruning), `ApiFieldRow` (recursive fields with type links), and
`ApiCodeRail` (server-generated code samples with a language switcher + a
response-example status toggle), rendering any page
kind — operation, schema, section, or the root overview. Everything it draws is
pre-resolved on the view-model; the components hold only the look.

`getApiPage` also returns the page's versioning identity — `collection`,
`version`, and `coordinate`. Threading them into `NimbusHead` emits the
canonical + cross-version alternates on the coordinate axis, and into
`ApiLayout` lights up the version picker and the deprecated-version banner. A
single-version spec returns `version: null`, so both features stay dormant with
no extra wiring.

`ApiLayout` renders the three-column region, not the document shell. The
generated starter's `BaseLayout` already owns metadata, global styles, search,
theme, agent directives, and page-wide copy-button wiring; its `Header` provides
the mobile-menu trigger. Compose the route through that normal shell as shown
below. If the project has replaced either component, adapt the imports and
markup to its equivalent shell while preserving every prop passed here.

Write `src/pages/api/[...slug].astro`:

<!-- api-reference-fixture:src/pages/api/[...slug].astro -->
```astro
---
import { getApiRoute, getApiStaticPaths } from "@cloudflare/nimbus-docs/runtime";
import Header from "@/components/Header.astro";
import { ApiLayout } from "@/components/ui/api-layout";
import BaseLayout from "@/layouts/BaseLayout.astro";

export const prerender = true;
export const getStaticPaths = getApiStaticPaths("api");

const result = await getApiRoute(Astro);
if (result instanceof Response) return result;
const { page, nav, collection, version, coordinate } = result;
const socialImage = `/og${page.href.replace(/\/$/, "")}.png`;
---

<BaseLayout
  title={`${page.title} · API`}
  description={page.description}
  markdownUrl={page.markdownHref}
  socialImage={socialImage}
  collection={collection}
  apiVersion={version ?? undefined}
  coordinate={coordinate}
>
  <Header showSidebar collection={collection} />
  <ApiLayout page={page} nav={nav} collection={collection} version={version} coordinate={coordinate} />
</BaseLayout>
```

The nav is handled by `ApiSidebar` inside `ApiLayout` — there's no separate
`ApiNavList` to write. To customise the tree's look (icons, grouping, a
collapse-all affordance), edit `src/components/ui/api-sidebar/`; the active/
expanded flags and verb come pre-resolved on each `ApiNavItem`.
## 5. Optional — add to the sidebar

Sidebar layout is taste-laden; ask before editing. If the user wants an "API"
entry in the site sidebar, add a manual link to the `sidebar.items` array in
the Nimbus config (the API collection isn't a docs tree, so `autogenerate`
won't apply to it):

```ts
{ label: "API", link: "/api" },
```

## 6. Verify

After writing all files, run the user's build command and confirm:

1. The build logs `Indexed N API pages for "api".`
2. `dist/api/index.html` (overview) and `dist/api/<slug>/index.html` exist.
3. `dist/api/index.md` and `dist/api/<slug>/index.md` exist and contain
   the rendered reference (operation method/path, request body, responses).
4. `dist/api/llms.txt` lists every API page, and the root `dist/llms.txt`
   includes `api` as a top-level section.
5. `dist/llms-full.txt` embeds the generated API Markdown.

Then tell the user the URLs to visit: `/api`, `/api/<slug>`,
`/api/<slug>/index.md`, `/api/llms.txt`.

**Case-only coordinate collisions:** if the spec has two names that differ only
by case (e.g. `createResponse` and `CreateResponse`), Nimbus emits a build
diagnostic and disambiguates the slugs — but on a case-insensitive filesystem
(default macOS/Windows) the two `.md`/`.html` files collide on disk. It builds
fine on case-sensitive CI/hosting (Linux, Cloudflare). If a page looks missing
locally, this is why — rename in the spec or build on Linux.

## 7. Already installed?

If `src/pages/api/[...slug].astro` already exists, do not overwrite it. Ask the
user whether to replace, skip, or show a diff first. The `api` entry in the
Nimbus config and the `apiCollection()` line in `src/content.config.ts` may also
already exist — check before editing.

Projects set up by an earlier version of this recipe keep the Nimbus config in
a separate file and pass the entry explicitly, as `apiCollection(apiConfig)`.
That still builds. Add a new spec to the `api` array in that file and register
it with a zero-argument `apiCollection()`. Move the config back into
`astro.config.ts` only if the user asks.
